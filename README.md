This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict UK house prices using historical data from 2015 to 2024. It includes advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering (temporal, geographic, property, market), and model training using optimized algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Random Forest, and ensemble methods. The goal is to achieve strong predictive performance

Phase 1 – Data Loading & Exploration

Phase 2 – Data Preprocessing & Quality

Phase 3 – Feature Engineering

Phase 4 – Model Training & Optimization

Phase 5 – Ensemble Learning

Phase 6 – Results & Evaluation**

**I use google collab but to run on local machine** 


# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-link>
